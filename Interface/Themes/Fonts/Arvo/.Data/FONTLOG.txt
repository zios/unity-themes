Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for
screen and print. The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic,
Roman Bold, Bold Italic. It is a libre font, first published
in Google Fonts. The flavour of the font is rather mixed. Its
monolinear-ish, but has a tiny bit of contrast (which
increases the legibility a little in Mac OS X.)

The name Arvo is a typical Estonian man's name, but is not
widely used today. In the Finnish language, Arvo means
"number, value, worth." Considering how much programming is
involved in hinting, all these meanings are true.
