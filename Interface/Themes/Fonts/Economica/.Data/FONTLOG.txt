Font Software.

Basic Font Information

Economica is the first digital typeface created in 
Montevideo, Uruguay, to be distributed internationally. 
The development of the typeface took most of 2007 and 
received the assistance of type design colleagues 
from all over Latin America.

Economica has four basic styles: Regular, Bold, Italic 
and Bold Italic. It includes a comprehensive character 
set that lets you work with diverse European languages.

This typeface family was designed for the output of 
inkjet printers. It was inspired by the concept of 
saving space in publishing texts without loss of height. 
This means it is a very condensed type.

The visual advantage of Econ—omica is that accomplishes 
this horizontal compression while keeping a strong 
personality. It is not a typical, neutral, sans serif. 
The open forms and tendency towards flattened curves 
allow it to be used in very small spaces while retaining 
high legibility.

Economica is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
