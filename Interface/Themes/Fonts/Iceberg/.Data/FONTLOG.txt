FONTLOG for the Iceberg font

This file provides detailed information on the Iceberg 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Iceberg fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Iceberg is a slim condensed decorative webfont
by Victor Kharyk suitable for medium to large sizes.
It is monolinear and mostly monospaced, has long ascenders
and descenders, and a modular construction that builds a rhythm. 
These features improve overall readability. Its monolinear 
strokes and 45 degree cuts echo letters made from folded tape.

Iceberg is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1
