History

I created the NovaCut font (a base of this font) about 14-15 years ago for 
making the inscriptions on stone. Initially the font contained only capitals 
and digits and existed only on paper and stone inscriptions. Last year 
I decided transfer this font to computer. I made missing small fonts and some 
basical signs and created a font initially named Gothica. By the way I made 
other versions of some letters. It was a lot of this at the end of my work. 
I decided create new fonts based on these letters. And finally I created 
six fonts family and named these fonts Nova (NovaCut, NovaFlat, NovaOval, 
NovaRound, NovaSlim, NovaSquare - by the shape of individual fonts).
At last I created monospace font - NovaMono - the seventh part of this family.
