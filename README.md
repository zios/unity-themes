<h2>Description <sup><em>(What is this?)</em></sup></h2>

This addon provides the Unity Editor with adjustable, hot-swappable GUI themes across all elements using native and custom data formats.

<h2>Reason <sup><em>(Why was it made?)</em></sup></h2>

The system was initially created to provide on-the-fly adjustable styling standards for custom editor windows/inspectors/properties. It was later extended for global editor usage. It's intended to allow users to establish general-purpose aesthetics that are adaptable to needs as well as uniform to their existing development applications.

<h2>Features <sup><em>(What can it do?)</em></sup></h2>

* Supports swapping of editor themes globally or between individual custom editors.
* Supports palette (color) adjustment. Palettes are usable between different themes. Alt+F1 and Alt+F2 are hotkeys for previous and next palette.
* Supports system color usage (select Windows versions only) as well as manual adjustment.
* Supports forced interval repainting as Responsive UI option to allow for global hover/interaction effects.
* Supports theme variations and keywords within <samp>.unityTheme</samp> files.
* Supports GUIStyle and GUIContent overriding in base skin as well as static style-container instances.

<h2>Compatibility <sup><em>(What environments will it function with?)</em></sup></h2>

Currently, the system has been built and tested on Unity 5.0 through 5.4b21 on Windows/Mac/Linux.

<h2>Issues <sup><em>(What problems are known?)</em></sup></h2>
